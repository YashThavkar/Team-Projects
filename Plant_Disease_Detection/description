"As part of our final-year bachelor's team project, we developed a Plant Disease Detection System that leveraged real-time images to enhance testing accuracy. "
"Using advanced machine learning techniques, we trained the model on a diverse dataset of plant images, enabling it to identify various diseases with high precision. "
"The integration of real-time image processing significantly improved the model's performance in practical scenarios, making it a valuable tool for early disease detection and prevention in agriculture. "
"This project showcased our ability to apply AI technologies to solve real-world problems effectively."
